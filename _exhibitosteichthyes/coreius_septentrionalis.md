### Descriptions

Coreius septentrionalis has a long, stout body with a flattened tail. Its body is light grey with a slight yellowish tinge, with cyanotic spots on the sides of the body. Its belly is silvery white with a slight yellowish tinge while its dorsal fins are greyish black and its other fins are greyish yellow [1].

Coreius septentrionalis is a subtropical freshwater fish and it is distributed in the Huanghe River, China. It is mainly found in a section of the Yellow River of about 200 km from Jingyuan in Gansu to Zhongwei in Ningxia. It can be found in lower and middle levels of water bodies with the sluggish current in the sandy and rocky substratum. It hides beneath deep water rocks or in ponds in winter and migrates upstream in spring for breeding purposes [2].

On one hand, long-term uncontrolled exploitation and severe overfishing have led to a dramatic decline in numbers. On the other hand, the construction of water conservancy hubs such as Sanmenxia has blocked the migratory pathways of the Coreius septentrionalis, which, combined with altered hydrological conditions, has affected the habitat of the spawning grounds. The combination of many factors has led to its current endangered status.
