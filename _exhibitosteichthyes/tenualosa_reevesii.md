## Descriptions

Characteristics: Its head is laterally flattened and the anterior end is blunt. Back of the head is usually smooth. The dorsal surface of the body is green. The sides and belly are silvery white with spots on the side of the body in juveniles. Males are average 44 cm in length and 1.3 kg in weight[1].

Distribution: Tenualosa reevesii normally inhabits seawater and makes its reproductive migration up rivers in late spring and early summer [2]. Juveniles grow within the rivers and lakes and generally grow to about 150mm before entering the sea, where they develop and grow. It is found in Fujian, Jiangxi, Hainan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan provinces in China.

Conservation: The increasing pollution of the waters of the Yangtze River, coupled with over-fishing, especially of young shad, has contributed to the imminent extinction of the shad.
