## Descriptions

Kaluga (Huso dauricus) is very large, weighing up to 100kg or more. Its body is black green to light grey on the back, yellowish on the sides, and white on the belly. In addition, the early morphology is more similar to that of Acipenser schrencki [1]. Its body is thick and long in a conical shape, with a pointed and slender head and tail. The tail is crooked, with the upper lobe large and extending posteriorly [2].

Kaluga is one of the speciality fish of Heilongjiang province, China. It is a fish that lives in the lower and middle layers of rivers. They live in freshwater all year round and do not migrate long distances.

By the end of the 19th century, the naturally occurring populations of sturgeon in the Heilongjiang River were large. From the 20th century onwards, there was a problem of overfishing. The demand for caviar led to a dramatic decline in Kaluga.
