## Descriptions
Characteristics: Kaluga (Huso dauricus) is very large, weighing up to 100kg or more. The whole body is covered with 5 rows of bony plates, the muzzle length is less than 70% of the head length, and the muzzle whiskers are 4. The highest point of the body is at the first dorsal plate, which is the largest, with a posterior dorsal fin plate, and the body is black green to light grey on the back, yellowish on the sides, and white on the belly. In addition, the early morphology is more similar to that of Acipenser schrencki (Pan, 2007). Its body is thick and long in a conical shape, with a pointed and slender head and tail. The head is slightly triangular, with 2 pairs of tentacles anterior to the mouth, the medial pair more forward. The eyes are small and the right and left gill membranes are interconnected. The body has 5 longitudinal rows of rhombic bony plates with sharp, slightly curved spines. The skin of the rest of the fish is rough and scaleless. The body surface is blackish-blue with yellow sides and a greyish-white ventral surface, the dorsal bony plates are yellow and the lateral bony plates are yellowish-brown. The tail is crooked, with the upper lobe large and extending posteriorly (Li, 2013).

Habitat: Kaluga is one of the speciality fish of Heilongjiang province, China, generally weighing between 50 and 150 kg. It is a fish that lives in the lower and middle layers of rivers. They live in freshwater all year round and do not migrate long distances.

Conservation:  By the end of the 19th century, the naturally occurring populations of sturgeon in the Heilongjiang River were large. From the 20th century onwards, there was a problem of overfishing. The demand for caviar led to a dramatic decline in Kaluga.
