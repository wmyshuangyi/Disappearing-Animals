##Description

The black-footed albatross (Phoebastria nigripes) is a large seabird of the albatross family Diomedeidae with a length of 68--74 cm. They have almost all black plumage, only some adults show white undertail coverts. The beak and the base of the beak under the eyes are gray. The feet are black [1].

During their breeding period, black-footed albatrosses mainly inhabit small islands in the open ocean, seas, inhabit grasslands, beaches and slopes with little vegetation. During the non-breeding period, they mainly move and inhabit the open ocean and bay areas. Black-footed albatrosses feed on Marine invertebrates such as cephalopods and mollusks, as well as fish. They do not hunt for food in the air, nor do they dive into the water to forage, but mainly at the surface of the sea. 

The black-footed albatross was once found in the Fujian province, China at any time of the year, but became rare by the end of the 20th century due to environmental pollution and massive human demand for black-footed albatross feathers and eggs, therefore, they need to be protected [1][2].
