## Description

The saunders's gull (Chroicocephalus saundersi) or the Chinese black-headed gull, is a species of gull with black beak and red feet. Its length is around 33 cm. In summer, the head feathers are black. There are white stellar-moon-shaped patches around the eyes, which stand out on the black head. Only parts of the underwing primary feathers are black, in sharp contrast to the white of the entire underwing surface and lower body. Wintertime feathers are similar to summertime feathers, but the head is white with light brown spots on the crown, and black spots are on the ear area [1].

It often moves in small groups, mostly in and out of the open coastal saline alkali land and swamp, especially the muddy beach with dwarf saline alkali plants. It mainly inhabit China , Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Macau, Russia, and Vietnam, which feeds on crabs and other worms by suddenly plummeting in flight, turning around as they approach the ground. It almost never moves through water, if they make a mistake in predation, they will quickly fly into the air [1].

The distribution area of Saunders's gull is narrow and its population is rare. According to the survey on Bohai coast in June 1993, the breeding population is about 634. According to the Winter Survey of Asian wetland birds organized by the International Bureau of Waterfowl Research in 1990, 1559 birds were found in China, 27 in Japan and 24 in North Korea [2].
