## Description

The oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana) is a large wader at 100–129 cm long, and 110–150 cm tall. The base of the beak is thick, tapering toward the tip, and slightly upturned. The exposed skin around the eyes, liner and throat colour is vermilion, while the iris inside the eye is pink and the outer ring is black. The plumage on the body is mainly pure white. The wings are broad and long, and the upper large, primary, primary and secondary coverts are black with a green or purple sheen. The lower part of the foreneck has long lanceolate feathers that can rise upright when showing off in courtship. The legs and feet are very long, and are bright red [1].

It often forages in swamps, wetlands and ponds, mainly feeding on small fish, frogs and insects. It is quiet and alert, often being slow while flying or walking, and standing on one foot at rest. It begins to breed in March, nesting on tall trees or buildings in the middle and north of Northeast China [1].

Wetland destruction and over-harvesting destruction are the main reasons that cause to the number of the species declining. The latest statistics show that the global population of the endangered Oriental white stork has reached more than 9,000. Since October 2020, more than 5,000 oriental storks have been monitored migrating to Tianjin, China. The number of oriental storks inhabiting in Tianjin has exceeded 50 percent of the world's total [2].
