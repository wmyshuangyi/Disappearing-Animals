## Description

The yellow-breasted bunting (Emberiza aureola) is a small songbird with a body length of 14-15 cm. The forehead, cephalic side, chin and upper throat colour are black. The tail is chestnut brown. The middle plumes are white, forming very obvious white spots. The tail is covered with several pure white feathers; The rest of the lower body is bright yellow. The beak is cone-shaped and thinner than that of finches. [1]

It inhabits thickets, meadows, grasslands and forest margins in low hills and open plains. During the breeding period, they often move alone or in pairs. During the non-breeding period, they like to swarm in groups, especially during migration and winter, integrating into large groups of hundreds to thousands of birds, up to 3500-7000 birds. The general staple food is plant seeds [1].

The species' numbers have declined dramatically since the early 2000s. The decrease in the number of the yellow-breasted bunting is likely to be caused by a large number of catches during migration. In addition, the change of paddy field irrigation mode reduces the quality and quantity of overwintering habitat, including the reduction of water stubble, the reduction of reed bed and the reduction of available habitat.
