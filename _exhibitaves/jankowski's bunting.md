Its body colour is brown chestnut, and there are black and brick red longitudinal stripes on its back.

It mostly inhabits hillside grassland with dwarf trees, river banks, shrubs in hilly grassland, dry grassland, dune shrub and weed grassland in Piedmont platform. It is timid and suspicious. When sensing people approaching, it hides in bushes or grass. Its staple food is plant seeds [1].

According to the relevant reports, it is experiencing an extremely rapid decline. In many places where the species was previously abundant, the number of this species has decreased by 50-79% over past 11 years [2].
