## Description

The hainan peacock-pheasant (plectron katsumatae) is one of the rare and endangered pheasants. The male bird is 50-67 cm long and weighs 456-710 grams. The female bird is 33-52 cm long and weighs 460-500 grams. Male birds often have crests on their heads, soft body feathers, generally brown or grayish brown faces, metallic eye spots on their wings and tails, 20-24 tail feathers on their tails, the central tail feathers about twice as long as the outermost ones, and the secondary flight feathers on both wings almost as long as the primary flight feathers. Female birds are smaller in size, simpler and duller in feather color, and have fewer eye spots.

They live in 1,500 meters of mountains and bamboo bushes, often move alone or in pairs, and rarely fly to the tree. At night, they perch on branches. The food is almost all insects and worms.
