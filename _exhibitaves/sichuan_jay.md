## Description

The Sichuan jay is a species of bird in the family Corvidae, which is endemic to China. The body feathers are black and grayish brown, and there is no bright colour throughout the body. The tail is very short; the beak is blunt and short; and its wings, waist and tail are less brown [1].

It mainly feeds on insects such as locusts, scarab beetles, needleworms, mole crickets and grubs, insect larvae and pupae, as well as nestlings, bird eggs, mice, carrion, animal carcasses, plant leaves, buds, fruits, seeds and crop seeds [1].

The Sichuan jay inhabits subtropical or tropical moist montane forests. However, the range and suitability of suitable habitat are greatly reduced under the influence of climate change [2].
