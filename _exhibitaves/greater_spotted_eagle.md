## Description

The greater spotted eagle is a large bird of prey with a length of 61-74 cm and a weight of 1320-2100 grams. The whole body is dark brown, and the back is slightly decorated with purple luster. The chin, throat and chest clolour are black brown, and the rest of the lower body is slightly lighter than black brown [1].

The greater spotted eagle inhabits grasslands and woodlands near wetlands in Northeast China, North China, East China, Central and Southern China. It preys on fish, frogs, and mice, as well as chafers and locusts [1][2].

The main factor causing to the decline is deforestation and increased human economic activity. In the 1960s, the original forest in Changbai Mountain remained in a good state. However, since 1970, forests have been cut down except for nature reserves. The habitat of greater spotted eagles has been destroyed, a wide range of feeding places have been shrinking, which results in population decline [2].
