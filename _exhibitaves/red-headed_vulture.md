It is found in tropical rain forests, open areas at the forest margins of southern tropical monsoon rain forests, open country fields, arable land and semi-desert areas. It is mainly distributed in Nepal, northern India and Yunnan province of China.

Historical reports indicate that this species was once widely distributed and abundant in population, but it has experienced a large-scale decline in quantity and range over the past decade. The most recent information shows that species in India experienced a rapid decline (41 percent per year) after 1999, with a 91 percent decline between the early 1990s and 2003. The decline and mortality in the Indian subcontinent was due to the use of pesticides (the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac). The pesticides used to treat livestock but widely ingested by the species, thereby resulting in its population decline [2].
