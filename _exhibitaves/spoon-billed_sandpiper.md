The spoon-billed sandpiper is usually found alone in shallow water and soft mud near the water. When walking, the head is always lowered and the beak is constantly stuck into the water or mud. It feeds mainly on insects, insect larvae, crustaceans and other small invertebrates [1]. 

The species is listed as key protested animal in China because it is experiencing extremely rapid decline. There are many factors cause to the decline, including reproduction, loss of habitat and loss of wintering land, which are affected by disturbance, pollution, hunting and climate change. Urgent action is needed to prevent the extinction of this species [2].
