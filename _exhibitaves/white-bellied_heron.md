They inhabit swamps, grasslands, and wide farmlands in India, Bhutan , Bangladesh and Myanmar, usually moving in small groups of 4-5 individuals. The species is very alert and sensitive to human disturbance, for example, a disturbed breeding pair takes 48 hours to return to their breeding site [2]. They mainly feed on aquatic creatures, including fish, shrimp, frogs and insects [1].

The white-bellied heron is classified as endangered bird due to its narrow distribution area and rare quantity. The main threats that cause to population decline are widespread loss, degradation and human disturbance of forests and wetlands. On November 24, 2019, a white-bellied heron was identified by researchers in Changning County, Baoshan City, Yunnan Province. It was released on March 22 after receiving rescue aid from local authorities. The white-belted heron was fitted with a satellite tracking recorder and anklet and will be monitored to make rescue measures effectively [3].
