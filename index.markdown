 <h2>Welcome to DWA</h2>
             <p>Wild animals are important natural resources, which can maintain the stability and balance of the ecosystem. Therefore, wild animals are the ecological resources that human beings should protect. However, statistics show that the extinction rate of wildlife is on the rise, and more and more species are facing a crisis of survival. In view of this, the protection of wild animals has been attached great importance by the governments of all countries, and China has also begun to participate in the action of protecting wild animals. On January 14, 1989, China issued a list of key protected wild animals, and made a specific division of aquatic and terrestrial animals. The protection levels are also divided into primary and secondary levels.</p>
             <br>
             <p>After more than 30 years of experience and lessons in wildlife conservation and management, the new list of state key protected wildlife was officially announced on February 5, 2021. Compared with the original list, there are two major changes in the new list. First, on the basis of preserving all species in the original list, 65 wild animals, including jackal and Yangtze finless porpoises, have been upgraded from second-class state protection to first-class state protection. Three wild animals, ursine monkey, northern goat and boa constrictor, have been adjusted from the first class state protected wild animals to the second class state protected wild animals due to their stable population and wide distribution.
