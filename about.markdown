<h1>About</h1>
<p><strong>W</strong>ild animals as important natural resources which can maintain the stability and balance of the ecosystem, should be protected by human beings. However, statistics show that the extinction rate of wildlife is on the rise, and more and more species are facing a crisis of survival. In view of this, the protection of wild animals has been attached great importance by the governments of all countries, and China has also participated in the action of protecting wild animals. On January 14, 1989, China issued a list of key protected wild animals, with a clear distinction between aquatic and terrestrial animals, and classifies wildlife into first and second protection classes based on the degree of threat they face.</p>
<br>

<p>After more than 30 years of experience and lessons in wildlife conservation and management, the new list of state key protected wildlife was officially announced on February 5, 2021. Compared with the original list, there are two major changes in the new list. First, on the basis of preserving all species in the original list, 65 wild animals, including jackal and Yangtze finless porpoises, have been upgraded from second-class state protection to first-class state protection. Three wild animals, ursine monkey, northern goat and boa constrictor, have been adjusted from the first class state protected wild animals to the second class state protected wild animals due to their stable population and wide distribution. Second, 517 species (categories) of wild animals were added. Wolves and other 473 species are listed as second-class protected wild animals. More significantly, there are 43 species experiencing severe population decline, being directly added in the national first-class protection of wild animals.</p>
<br>

<p>The aim of our website is to introduce the 43 species of wild animals that are in rapid decline, and to call on everyone to join the action to protect them. In order to provide you with enriched and interesting experience, we divide these 43 species of animals into six groups according to the class they belong to, including <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mammalia">mammalia</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/aves">aves</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/reptilia">reptilia</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/amphibia">amphibia</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/osteichthyes">osteichyes</a>, and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/insecta">insecta</a>, and use multimedia (such as texts, photographs and videos) to show these animals. Due to copyright or lack of resources, some images are not of the specific animals but of the family or genus to which they belong, and we use '*' to indicate them.In addition, all these animals are encoded for structured search. </p>
