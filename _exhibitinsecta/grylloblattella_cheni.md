## Descriptions

Characteristics: Modern grylloblattids are 14–34 mm long, wingless, pale, and either nocturnal or cavernicolous. Adults have long cerci with 5–10 segments, and females have a sword-shaped ovipositor similar in shape to that of katydids (Bai M et al., 2010).

Habitat: Grylloblattids may live on northern talus slopes, or in the snow at higher altitudes, or even in ice-covered caves at lower altitudes. They live mainly in caves, soil, and crevices in rocks. They feed mainly on carrion, but will also eat other insects, plants, debris, etc. It was once found somewhere in Xinjiang, China, but is extremely rare.

Conservation status: Grylloblattella cheni is an extremely rare insect that is rarely seen by the general public. Only a very few museums in the world have specimens of the cockroach in single numbers.
