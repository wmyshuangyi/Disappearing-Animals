## Descriptions

Characteristics: The adult Onychodactylus zhaoermii has an elongated body with a cylindrical trunk, with a prominent ridge from the posterior head to the base of the tail; the tail length is significantly greater than the head length, and the anterior part of the tail is cylindrical, with smooth skin on the back of the body and a shallow longitudinal groove from the posterior corner of the eye to the nuchal fold; there are 11-12 rib grooves (Poyarkovet et al., 2012). The hindlimbs are longer and stouter than the forelimbs and are dorsally yellowish-brown, orange and light orange-red, with small fine brown spots on the dorsal surface of the head and irregular thick black-brown reticulate spots on the dorsal surface of the body tail. Its ventral surface is pale orange.

Habitat: Onychodactylus zhaoermii is found in densely vegetated mountainous areas at around 600m above sea level. It often inhabits near the source of streams or spring ditches where the water is cool and rocky. The salamander is active during the day in damp conditions and after dusk or rain, feeding on shrimps, earthworms, mallets, tadpoles and insects, and it breeds from early May to early June.

Conservation: It is an endemic species in China. Only one distribution site of Onychodactylus zhaoermii has been found in China. Due to deforestation and pesticide application, the ecological quality of its habitat has declined.
