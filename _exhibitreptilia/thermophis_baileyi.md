## Descriptions

Thermophis baileyi, known commonly as Bailey's snake, and the Xizang hot-spring keelback, is a small to medium-sized snake, measuring 780 to 1,000 mm in total length. It has a short head and is not clearly distinguished from the neck. Its head and neck are clearly differentiated in colour, with the dorsal surface of the head grey-green, the ventral surface of the head light yellow, and the dorsal surface of the body and tail olive-green, with three rows of dark brown maculae, the middle row being the largest [1]. 

Thermophis baileyi is endemic to Tibet, China. It is known to live near hot springs at altitudes of 3960-4,350m in rock piles, waterfronts, and swampy meadows, feeding mainly on fish, rats, and alpine frogs. 

Thermophis baileyi is considered Near Threatened by IUCN [2]. Thermophis baileyi has a very special habitat and a narrow distribution area, especially as it occurs only near certain hot springs in the Himalayan troughs. Due to the development of geothermal power stations and other anthropogenic influences, its habitat has been severely damaged, and the population has been significantly reduced.
