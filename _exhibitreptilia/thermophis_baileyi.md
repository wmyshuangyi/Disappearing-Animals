## Descriptions

Characteristics: Thermophis baileyi, known commonly as Bailey's snake, and the Xizang hot-spring keelback, is a small to medium-sized snake, measuring 780 to 1,000 mm in total length. It has a short head and is not clearly distinguished from the neck. It has 8 upper labial scales and 1 buccal scale; 2 pre-orbital scales and 3 post-orbital scales; and 2 + 3 temporal scales. Its dorsal scales have 19-19-17 rows, all but the outermost row angled. Its dorsal surface is yellowish brown or olive-green with 3 dark brown patches, the central row being larger and flanked by several fine longitudinal lines of varying shades. The ventral surface is yellowish brown or yellowish green, with 1 black spot on each side of the ventral scales, forming a chain-like pattern. The head and neck are clearly differentiated in colour, with the dorsal surface of the head grey-green, the ventral surface of the head light yellow, and the dorsal surface of the body and tail olive-green, with three rows of dark brown maculae, the middle row being the largest (CWCA, 2002). 

Habitat: Thermophis baileyi is endemic to Tibet, China. It is known to live near hot springs at altitudes of 3960-4,350m in rock piles, waterfronts, and swampy meadows, feeding mainly on fish, rats, and alpine frogs. 

Conservation status: Thermophis baileyi is considered Near Threatened by IUCN (Rao and Li, 2014). Thermophis baileyi has a very special habitat and a narrow distribution area, especially as it occurs only near certain hot springs in the Himalayan troughs. Due to the development of geothermal power stations and other anthropogenic influences, its habitat has been severely damaged, and the population has been significantly reduced.
