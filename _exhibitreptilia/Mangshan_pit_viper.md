## Descriptions

Mangshan pit viper (Protobothrops mangshanensis), which can reach over two meters in length, is a venomous snake with tubular teeth, black-brown in color, interspersed with very small yellow-green or rust-colored dots, forming a fine reticulated impression [1]. It is the largest known species of a venomous snake, with the heaviest living Mangshan pit viper ever found being 8.5kg [2].

The Mangshan pit viper is found mainly in the subtropical coniferous and broad-leaved forests of the Mang Mountains in Hunan Province, China. It prefers to lurk and rest in shady areas, sometimes hiding in caves. It is carnivorous and will track its prey to find an opportunity to hunt.

This species is listed as "Endangered" by the IUCN[3]and its number is only about 500 in China.
