## Descriptions

Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is the oldest extant reptile. The body is 100-200 cm long and weighs about 100 kg. The head is large, about 15 cm wide; both upper and lower jaws have extremely hooked rostrums. The dorsal surface of the head has symmetrical scales and the dorsal surface of the adult is unribbed. The ventral nail is flatter, with three lower marginal horn plates at each side of the nail bridge. The ventral angular plates, femoral angular plates and anal angular plates are in turn tapering. The limbs are flattened and flipper-like; the forelimbs are large and the hindlimbs are smaller, each with 2 claws on the inside, 1 more than the green turtle, suitable for swimming. The dorsum is brownish red or maroon with irregular earthy or brown markings [1].

The Loggerhead Sea turtle is found in the waters of southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. In China it is found in coastal areas and in the waters beyond the Yangtze River in Shanghai. The species mainly inhabit warm-water waters, especially along the continental shelf, and often frequent coral reefs, but also enter bays, estuaries, and saltwater lakes [2], feeding on fish, shrimps, crabs, mollusks and algae. When the water becomes cold, loggerhead turtles migrate to warmer areas of the sea or hibernate. In the coldest months they dive for up to seven hours at a time, surfacing for just seven minutes to breathe. This is one of the longest recorded dives of any air-breathing marine vertebrate [3].

Predatory indiscriminate fishing and indiscriminate digging for turtle eggs are important reasons for the sharp decline in turtle resources in the Xisha Islands.
