## Descriptions

Characteristics: Varanus bengalensis (also called Bengal monitor) has yellow spots on its body, a triangular head and a body length of over 90 cm, with the tail alone being 50 cm long. It has reached 10.2 kg, and in the wild, males are generally more than 42% heavier than females. The nostrils are cleft-eyed and located centrally between the eyes and the muzzle. The western and eastern subspecies can be distinguished by their body colour and scale shape. Adult Bengal lizards are generally grey or grey-green with grey-black markings from the chin to the ventral tail, these markings are usually darker in the west and lighter in the east. These ventral markings usually become darker as the skin ages. In the wild, the heaviest male Bengal lizard recorded was 7.18 kg in weight (Farmer and Wright, 2012).

Habitat: Bengal monitor is extremely capable of surviving a wide range of habitats, from deserts to tropical rainforests, with seasonally snowy winters. However, it is generally found in areas of persistently warm climates, where seasonal monsoon influence patterns occur in the surrounding seas and mountains. The most common habitats for this species are deciduous, semi-deciduous, evergreen tropical rainforests. The western subspecies inhabits drier areas, and the eastern subspecies inhabits wetter environments. It is mainly active on the ground but will climb trees or hide in scrub if it is in danger. 

Conservation Status: The main threat to the species is habitat destruction, with indirect effects being pesticide contamination of the agricultural territories in which the species survives and the reduction of available food resources. Perhaps the greatest threat, however, is the hunting of the species by humans, for the commerce of its skin and the usual consumption of their meat. The fat of the species is also used in traditional medicine. Bengal monitor is listed as Near Threatened under criteria A2d[2].
