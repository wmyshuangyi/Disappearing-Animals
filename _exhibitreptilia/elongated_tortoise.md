## Descriptions
Characteristics: Elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata) is about 1 kg as an adult and is classified as a medium-sized tortoise. The adult dorsal carapace is more than 20 cm long and can reach a maximum of about 40 cm. Its upper jaw has three serrated teeth. The eyes are large, and the neck is short. The back armor is long, with a cervical shield and a flat ridge. The rump shield is single and wrapped downwards. The ventral armor is large, with a flat and thick anterior margin and a deep posterior notch; the forelimbs are 5-clawed and the hindlimbs 4-clawed; there is no webbing between the fingers and toes. The tail is short and thick, with a claw-like horny projection at its tip. Its head is pale yellowish green to greyish white in color and its body is pale yellowish-brown with irregular black patches on each shield (individually without patches); the limbs are covered with irregular black patches (Zhang, 1998). 

Habitat: It occurs in Guangxi and Yunnan in China. The Elongated tortoise inhabits mountains, hills and scrubby forests and is active at night, preferring warmth and fearing cold. They are mainly herbivorous, but also feed on animal food, including melons, fruits, vegetables and lean meat. Growing temperature 23-32°C, best 26-30°C (Zhao and Huang, 2016).

Coservation status: The elongated tortoise is a critically endangered species and is in severe decline across its natural range (Rahman et al., 2019). The turtle's survival has been decimated by the unrestricted capture and sale of the species as a resource animal by people of its origin, and especially by the massive smuggling of imports and exports in some countries.
