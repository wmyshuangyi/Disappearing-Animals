## Description

Tibetan argali (Ovis hodgsoni) is mostly brown, and its buttocks are lighter than its torso in spring. The tail is very small, about 2.5-5.8 cm. The hair of the hind legs and front legs is obviously divided into light and dark parts, and there is usually a dark stripe from the chest to the hoof. Male Tibetan argali has a thick curved angle, which can be more than 1 meter long, twisted downward in a spiral shape, and has a ring edge on the outside, which does not form a complete circle. The female's horns are very short and not very curved.

Tibetan argali is a typical mountain animal, and likes to live in semi-open mountain bare rock belt and rolling hills. They are distributed in alpine grasslands, alpine deserts, alpine meadows and other environments with an altitude of 2,500 meters to 5,000 meters. In summer, they often move to the lower edge of the snow line. In winter, when the habitat is covered with deep snow, they move from high places to low-altitude valleys to live. It is mainly active in the morning and dusk, and it also feeds during the day in winter. It mainly feeds on Gramineae, Allium and weeds. They are distributed in Nepal, India and China's Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and their sharp decline is caused by habitat loss caused by competition with livestock and human encroachment.
