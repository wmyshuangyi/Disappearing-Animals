Their eyes are very small and have no lens, which is actually equivalent to blindness, but they can feel the intensity and direction of light. Navigation and foraging use echolocation. Usually they act alone or in loose groups, and they don't form rigorous groups with obvious interaction. Ganges river dolphin feeds on fish and shrimp, including carp and catfish. It is a freshwater dolphin that lives in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. Industrial, agricultural and human pollution and human hunting are the reasons why Ganges river dolphin is endangered.
