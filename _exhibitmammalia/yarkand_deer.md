## Description

Yarkand deer (Cervus elaphus yarkandensis) is an endemic subspecies of red deer in Xinjiang, which is mainly distributed along the Tarim River and its tributaries. It is the only subspecies of red deer that inhabits the desert landscape. Since the 1960s, with the development of Tarim Basin and the intensification of human economic activities, its distribution area has rapidly retreated, and the population number has been decreasing day by day.

In 1972, this subspecies was listed as an endangered species by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and listed in the Red Book. China only designated it as the second-class protection together with other subspecies. Because this subspecies occupies an important position in the desert biological community and can adapt to the harsh desert environment, it has high value.
