It is mainly distributed in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, southern Yunnan, China (possibly extinct).

In the 1970s and 1990s, in Xishuangbanna, southern Yunnan, China, most of the main habitats of raccoon dog were reclaimed and planted with rubber, which made the habitat disappear too much.
