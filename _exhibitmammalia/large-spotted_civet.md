There are 2 black stripes on the lower part of the neck; The back is grayish brown, with a black line running from the shoulder to the hip, and a large dark brown spot on the back; There is no sheath at all on the third and fourth toes of the front foot. There are very clear round to square spots on the back of the body. These spots are arranged in several rows, and the middle of the spots is pale. The middle ridge is black and clearly separated from the spots. There are four black rings at the tail, and the tail is black.
They mainly inhabit tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia, monsoon forest, forest edge valleys, mountain sparse tree bushes and grass bushes along river valleys, mainly distributed in Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Thailand.


Hunting is the main risk factor. In addition, the narrow distribution area and the relative isolation of population distribution are also the reasons for the small population.
