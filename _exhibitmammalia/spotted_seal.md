Because its fur is beautiful and glossy, and it has excellent cold-proof and waterproof performance, it is often used to make fur coats, fur hats, leather mattresses and so on. Its fat can be refined and its meat can be eaten. In addition, the genitals of male seals are called seal kidney in traditional Chinese medicine, which has the effects of tonifying kidney, strengthening yang, replenishing essence and filling marrow, and is mainly used for impotence, spermatorrhea, weak waist and knee fistula, etc. People killed a large number of pelts and genitals in order to get spotted seal, which drastically reduced its number, and it is urgent to strengthen the protection work.
