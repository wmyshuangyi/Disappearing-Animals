In oder to fulfil the purpose as a resource for public education, and to bring them a good viewing experience, 
we structurally divide these 43 new added threatened animials into six categories according to their classes, 
and provide functional interfaces such as homepage, about, and search. In addition, 
we enrich the introduction of each kind of animals and the visual effects of users through various media forms, such as texts, 
pictures and videos, so as to attract the public to browse. 
The specific design details are as follows:

- First of all, we choose green that symbolizes nature, energy and vitality as the main color of the website, 
aiming to visually present users with a green and natural atmosphere, and simultaneously creating a proper website ideology of protecing animals.

- Moreover, we effectively organise the homepage, allowing viewers to learn about the theme of the site through the textual and visual elements 
as soon as they enter the homepage. For example, we design a navigation bar at the top to help the audience understand how the website is organized 
(Of course, the nagivation bar exists in each page of the website). 
Viewers can click on the name link of the class to which the animals belong to enter the related sub-pages.
If the audience tend to learn more about our website, we also guid them to click **About** page link to get more information. 
In addition, at the bottom of the homepage, the website also sets another text link to the word pages of six classes, 
and each animal species is attached with pictures, so that the public can better visually choose the target species. 

- On the page of each category, we list the names of the animals, 
with pictures, licenses, creators, and tags so that users can have an intuitive understanding and effectively find their target animal.
In terms of aesthetics, we arrange three animals in a row to ensure the readability of the page. 
Users can click on the corresponding animal picture and name to go to the introduction page for more details.  
In the description section, we combine text, images, and videos to meet the different needs of the user.

- If a user wants to skip the browsing step, they can go directly to the search page and refine their location by searching for keywords such as name, genus, 
family, etc. Strange to the complex classification names? Don't worry, 
we encode the common names in the tags, such as brid, cat, and eagle, so that users can search and find them 
even if they are not familiar with the taxonomy of animals.

- In the whole process of designing our website, we take full account of the needs of the user. 
The layout is mainly grid, which adapts better to the responsive pages. 
This allows users to use the site smoothly even when using smaller screen devices. 
In terms of accessibility, we designed web pages with contrasting colors, especially for important nodes, 
which change color when the mouse is placed over them to remind the user that they are operable.

- Finally, in order to expand the influence of the website and call for more people to understand and protect animals, 
the website has set the icon link of social media in the footer, and users can share information with their friends at any time. 
This function can expand the scope of public education.
